## Overview:
"Surf n' Shake" is a proposed business that will be located on the Island of Oahu.  Not only will the business sell and rent surfboards and related gear, it will sell ice cream, too.  A well-known surfer is very interesting in investing in "Surf n' Shake" but has expressed concern that poor weather could undermine the business' success.  The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the island's weather data and to evaluate its potential impact on Surf n' Shake's" success or failure.

* The temperature distribution is symmetrical in both June and December.  In other words, the mean and median for each month are the same.  In June the mean/median is 75<sup>o</sup>F/75<sup>o</sup>F.  In December, the mean/median is 71<sup>o</sup>F/71<sup>o</sup>F.  This implies that the island is not prone to extreme swings in temperature during those months.
* The mean temperature in Dec, 71<sup>o</sup>F, is only 4<sup>o</sup>F lower than the mean temperature in June, 75<sup>o</sup>F.  This indicates that the island maintains a fairly consistent temperature throughout the year.
* While the minimum temperature in December has dropped as low as 56 <sup>o</sup>F, this occurs infrequently.  The mean temperature in December is 71<sup>o</sup>F with a standard deviation of 4<sup>o</sup>F, indicating that the temperatures in December tend to range between 67<sup>o</sup>F to 75<sup>o</sup>F.

* The precipitation It appears that it rains daily on the Island of Oahu, but mediIn June the mean of 0.14" of rainfall is in the fourth quartile.  In December the mean of 0.22" is in the 4th quartile.  The median precipitation in both June and December is relatively light, however, spikes of 
* Unlike the temperature distribution, the precipitation data is skewed right in June and December.  In June the mean of 0.14" of rainfall is in the fourth quartile.  In December the mean of 0.22" is in the 4th quartile.  
* While the minimum temperature in December has dropped as low as 56 <sup>o</sup>F, this occurs infrequently.  The mean temperature in December is 71<sup>o</sup>F with a standard deviation of 4<sup>o</sup>F, indicating that the temperatures in December tend to range between 67<sup>o</sup>F to 75<sup>o</sup>F.


## Summary
* Throughout the year, the Island of Oahu maintains consistent and pleasant temperatures that are desirable for outdoor activities.
